"""Generic wrapper for svvamp elimination-round rules.

Rules like **Baldwin** and **Nanson** work by iteratively eliminating the
weakest candidate(s) until one survives.  Their ``scores_`` is a **2-D**
array ``[round, candidate]`` where ``np.inf`` marks an already-eliminated
candidate.

Co-winner semantics
-------------------
The co-winners are **all candidates that survive to the final round**, i.e.
all ``c`` such that ``scores_[-1, c] != np.inf`` (finite score in the last
elimination round).

In practice this means:

* **Single winner** — the normal case: one candidate has a finite score in
  the last row.
* **Tied final round** — multiple candidates share the same minimum Borda
  score in the penultimate round so none gets eliminated; all of them are
  co-winners.

Known rules that fit this pattern
-----------------------------------
* **Baldwin** — iterative Borda elimination (lowest Borda score eliminated
  each round, ties broken by highest index).
* **Nanson** — eliminates all candidates below the average Borda score each
  round.

Usage
------
Subclass :class:`EliminationBasedRuleWrapper`, set ``profile_`` and
``_inner``, then call :meth:`_init_elimination_based`::

    class BaldwinResult(EliminationBasedRuleWrapper):
        def __init__(self, profile: Profile) -> None:
            self.profile_ = profile
            self._inner = RuleBaldwin()(profile)
            self.cowinners_ = self._init_elimination_based()

    The subclass contract is identical to :class:`ScoreBasedRuleWrapper`:

    2. Set ``self._inner`` (executed svvamp rule instance).
    3. Call ``self._init_elimination_based()`` and assign the result to

    The method reads ``_inner.scores_`` (shape ``[n_rounds, n_candidates]``),
    looks at the **last round** (``scores_[-1, :]``), and returns all
    candidates with a finite score — those that survived all elimination
