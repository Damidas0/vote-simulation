        Svvamp's ``scores_`` is derived from ``matrix_victories_rk`` (rank-based),

        from ``matrix_victories_ut_abs``:

        * ``matrix_victories_ut_abs[c, d]`` = number of voters with
          ``ut[c] > ut[d]`` (strict utility preference).

        For each pair (c, d):
        * c gets **+1** if more voters prefer c over d than d over c (strict win).
        * c gets **+0.5** for an exact majority tie.
        * c gets **0** if c loses.

        This is the correct utility-consistent Copeland rule and guarantees that
        profiles with equal utilities produce equal scores — and thus correct
        co-winner sets — regardless of rank-breaking used internally by svvamp.
